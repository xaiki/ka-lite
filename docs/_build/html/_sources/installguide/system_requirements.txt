System requirements
===================

Supported Browsers
------------------
KA Lite is currently *not* supported on Internet Explorer version 8 or lower. You must use IE9 or later.

You can also use KA Lite on browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Safari!

The only known issue regards viewing videos on Windows XP, where you must use the Chrome browser.

On Ubuntu/Debian systems, install the `Ubuntu restricted extras package <https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/ubuntu-restricted-extras/>`_.
